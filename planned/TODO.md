# Core Infrastructure Tasks

> Note: Data persistence features are now managed as separate subprojects:
> - Container persistence: See `planned/container-persistence.md`
> - Standard persistence: See `planned/standard-persistence.md`

## High Priority

### User Configuration Script (configure-user.sh)
- Implement secure username/password input handling
- Add input validation for:
    - Username format and length
    - Password complexity
    - System username conflicts
- Implement template variable replacement ({{user}}, {{uid}}, {{gid}}, etc.)
- Implement secure password hashing
- Add system file updates with validation
- Add home directory creation with proper permissions
- Implement dependency checking on graft_delta.sh

### Build System Core
- Add validation checks for critical configuration files
- Implement --dry-run option for all scripts
- Add verbose logging options
- Implement file backup system
- Add rollback capability for failed operations

## Documentation

### Development Guidelines
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md with:
    - Code style guidelines
    - Pull request process
    - Development setup instructions
- Develop SECURITY.md including:
    - Security policy
    - Vulnerability reporting process
    - Security best practices

### User Documentation
- Enhance README.md with:
    - Quick-start guide
    - Troubleshooting section
    - Build status badges
- Add example configurations in delta/
- Document version tagging strategy

## CI/CD Infrastructure

### Testing Pipeline
- Set up automated testing:
    - Unit tests
    - Integration tests
    - Build verification
- Implement automated builds for all stages

### Security and Quality
- Add security scanning:
    - Dependency scanning
    - Container scanning
    - Code quality checks

### Release Management
- Implement release automation:
    - Version bumping
    - Changelog generation
    - Asset publishing

## Security Hardening

Our security measures are carefully selected to enhance system security while maintaining usability.

### Kernel and System Hardening

**Status: Partially Implemented**

✓ Implemented Features:
- **Kernel Parameter Hardening** (/etc/sysctl.d/99-security-hardening.conf):
    - Network stack protection against common attacks (SYN floods, IP spoofing)
    - Restricted IP forwarding and packet redirection
    - Disabled core dumps for security-sensitive processes
    - Improved memory protection against buffer overflows
    - Enhanced file system security controls

⊗ Planned Enhancements:
- AppArmor profile refinements for system services
- Kernel module blacklisting for unused hardware support
- Process scheduling and resource limits optimization
- Boot-time security parameter enforcement

### Authentication and Access Control

**Status: Planned**

⊗ Planned Features:
- Enhanced PAM configuration:
    - Strong password requirements using pam_pwquality
    - Account lockout after failed attempts
    - Password aging and history policies
    - Restricted sudo access and command logging
    - Session timeout configuration
    - USB storage device access controls

### Network Security

**Status: Partially Implemented**

⊗ Planned Enhancements:
- Network monitoring and analysis tools
- Automated intrusion detection
- Network segmentation improvements

### File System and Process Security

**Status: Planned**

⊗ Planned Features:
- Mount options hardening:
    - noexec, nosuid, nodev where appropriate
    - Separate partitions for /tmp, /var, /home
- File permission reviews and adjustments
- AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) implementation
- Process isolation and resource constraints
- Temporary file security enhancements

### Monitoring and Auditing

**Status: Planned**

⊗ Planned Features:
- Auditd configuration:
    - System call auditing
    - File access monitoring
    - Security event logging
- Enhanced logging configuration:
    - Remote logging setup
    - Log rotation and compression
    - Critical event alerting
- Regular system integrity checking
- Security compliance scanning tools

Note: This security configuration balances protection with usability, focusing on hardening measures appropriate for a live system environment. Some features may be configurable at runtime to allow user customization.
