# Container Persistence Subproject

## 1. Project Overview

The Container Persistence subproject implements a secure, user-friendly solution for preserving container states and data across sessions in non-persistent environments. The system utilizes a local container registry integrated with encrypted storage to provide transparent backup and restoration capabilities.

### 1.1 Goals

- Provide seamless container state preservation
- Maintain high security standards through encryption
- Automate complex registry operations
- Ensure reliable data persistence between sessions
- Minimize user interaction requirements

### 1.2 Key Features

- Transparent registry push/pull operations
- Automated container state tracking
- Encrypted storage integration
- Simple backup/restore interface
- Fallback to local storage when needed

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 System Components

```

│   ├── storage detection
│   ├── encryption management
│   └── mount point setup
├── registry-manager
│   ├── local registry config
│   ├── image tracking
│   └── push/pull operations
└── state-tracker
    ├── metadata storage
    ├── container config backup

```

### 2.2 Core Services

1. **Mount Handler Service**
- Manages encrypted storage detection and mounting
- Handles encryption key management
- Provides fallback mechanisms

2. **Registry Manager Service**
- Configures and maintains local registry
- Manages image pushing and pulling
- Handles registry authentication

3. **State Tracker Service**
- Tracks container metadata
- Preserves container names and labels
- Manages configuration storage

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Backup Workflow

1. User initiates backup operation
2. System validates encrypted storage availability
3. Storage volume is securely mounted with timeout monitoring
4. Container states are recorded
5. Images are pushed to local registry
6. Registry contents are copied to encrypted storage
7. Metadata and configurations are preserved
8. Storage is verified and securely unmounted
9. Audit log records mount/unmount events

### 3.2 Restore Workflow

1. User initiates restore operation
2. System validates encrypted storage
3. Storage is mounted with security timeout
4. Registry data is restored locally
5. Images are pulled from registry
6. Containers are recreated with preserved states
7. Storage is securely unmounted
8. Operation completion is logged

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Storage Security

- Full encryption of stored data
- Secure key management
- On-demand volume mounting with automatic timeout
- Protected mount operations with strict access controls
- Integrity verification
- Secure unmounting after operations complete

### 4.2 Runtime Security

- Secure handling of registry credentials
- Protection against unauthorized access
- Secure temporary data management
- Audit logging of operations
