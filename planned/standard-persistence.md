# Standard Persistence Specification

## Overview

The standard persistence subsystem provides secure, transparent data persistence for user files and system configurations in ephemeral environments. Unlike container persistence, this subsystem focuses on straightforward file and directory synchronization without the need for container metadata or registry management.

### Goals

- Provide transparent, secure persistence for user files and system configurations
- Encrypt all persisted data at rest
- Minimize system complexity while maintaining security
- Operate seamlessly alongside container persistence
- Support both automated and manual synchronization
- Enable secure data migration between systems

### Non-Goals

- Container image or registry management
- Complex dependency tracking
- Application state management
- Remote storage integration (initial version)

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Persistence Manager**
- Tracks synchronization paths and encryption settings
- Manages encryption keys and secure storage
- Handles file system events and triggers syncs

2. **Encryption Layer**
- Provides transparent encryption/decryption
- Manages secure key storage
- Ensures data integrity

3. **Synchronization Engine**
- Handles bi-directional file synchronization
- Manages file conflict resolution
- Provides atomic operations for data consistency

### Security Model

- All persisted data is encrypted at rest using industry-standard algorithms
- Keys are protected using hardware security features when available
- Strict permission controls on synchronized data
- On-demand volume mounting with security timeouts
- Immediate secure unmounting after operations
- Comprehensive audit logging of mount/unmount events
- Automatic volume cleanup on timeout or system shutdown

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Basic synchronization functionality
- Secure volume mount/unmount operations
- Mount timeout enforcement
- File/directory monitoring
- Atomic copy operations
- Conflict detection
- Operation audit logging

2. Encryption implementation
- Key generation and storage
- Transparent encryption/decryption
- Secure erasure

### Phase 2: Integration & Enhancement

1. System integration
- Automatic mount point detection
- Secure shutdown hooks
- System configuration persistence

2. Container persistence integration
- Coordination with container persistence subsystem
- Shared encryption infrastructure
- Non-interfering path management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. User features
- CLI tools for manual synchronization
- Configuration management
- Migration tools

2. Security enhancements
- Hardware security module support
- Additional encryption options
- Enhanced audit logging

## Interaction with Container Persistence

The standard persistence subsystem is designed to work alongside container persistence while maintaining separate concerns:

1. **Shared Infrastructure**
- Common encryption libraries and key management
- Shared secure storage mechanisms
- Unified logging and auditing

2. **Path Management**
- Non-overlapping path hierarchies
- Clear separation of container vs. standard data
- Coordinated mount point usage

3. **Resource Usage**
- Balanced resource allocation
- Cooperative scheduling
- Shared cache management

## Configuration

### System Configuration

```yaml
standard_persistence:
paths:
    - source: "/home/user"
    destination: "/mnt/secure/user"
    exclusions:
        - "*.tmp"
        - "Downloads"
encryption:
    algorithm: "AES-256-GCM"
    key_protection: "TPM"
sync:
    interval: "5m"
    on_events: true
```

### Security Configuration

```yaml
security:
encryption:
    providers:
    - type: "TPM"
        priority: 1
    - type: "software"
        priority: 2
audit:
level: "INFO"
storage_days: 30
mount_events: true
unmount_events: true
mount:
timeout: "15m"
retry_attempts: 3
force_unmount: true
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Remote Storage Integration**
- Cloud storage providers
- Network attached storage
- Distributed systems

2. **Enhanced Security Features**
- Multi-factor authentication
- Enhanced key rotation
- Secure sharing mechanisms

3. **Performance Optimizations**
- Incremental synchronization
- Compression
- Deduplication

4. **User Experience**
- GUI tools
- Status notifications
- Backup/restore utilities
