# Security-Enhanced Kernel Module Blacklist
# 
# This configuration blacklists kernel modules that could potentially be 
# exploited for attacks or data exfiltration. While these modules provide
# legitimate functionality, they are disabled by default to reduce attack 
# surface in environments where they are not strictly required.

# === Direct Memory Access (DMA) Interfaces ===
# These interfaces allow external devices direct access to system memory,
# which could be exploited for data theft or system compromise
blacklist firewire-core    # FireWire/IEEE 1394: Legacy high-speed interface with DMA access
blacklist thunderbolt      # Thunderbolt: Modern high-speed interface with DMA capabilities
                        # Both present risks of DMA attacks that can bypass memory protection

# === USB Attack Surface Reduction ===
# USB modules that could be used for malicious device spoofing or
# keystroke injection attacks
blacklist cdc-acm         # Disables USB modem/serial devices 
                        # Prevents BadUSB attacks and malicious serial device emulation

# === Network Protocol Attack Surface ===
# Legacy or high-risk network protocols that could be exploited
blacklist dccp            # Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
                        # Historically vulnerable to DoS attacks
blacklist sctp            # Stream Control Transmission Protocol
                        # Can be used to bypass network filtering
blacklist rds             # Reliable Datagram Sockets
                        # Previous vulnerabilities in implementation
blacklist tipc            # Transparent Inter-Process Communication
                        # Potential for network-based attacks

# === Potentially Dangerous Filesystems ===
# Filesystems that could be used for privilege escalation or data hiding
blacklist cramfs          # Compressed ROM filesystem
                        # Legacy compressed filesystem with known vulnerabilities
blacklist freevxfs        # VxFS filesystem driver
                        # Limited use, historically vulnerable
blacklist jffs2           # Journaling Flash File System
                        # Primarily for embedded, can be used to hide data
blacklist hfs             # Apple HFS filesystem
                        # Legacy macOS filesystem, limited security features
blacklist hfsplus         # Apple HFS+ filesystem
                        # Potential for resource exhaustion attacks

# === Debug and Development Interfaces ===
# Modules that could expose sensitive system information or 
# provide attack paths
blacklist kprobe          # Kernel probe - dynamic instrumentation system
                        # Could be used to modify kernel behavior
blacklist uvcvideo        # USB Video Class driver
                        # Can be exploited for surveillance
