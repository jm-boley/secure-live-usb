# Security Configuration: Prevent Automatic Device Mounting
#
# Purpose:
# - Disable automatic mounting and handling of removable storage devices
# - Require explicit user action to mount devices
# - Prevent automated exploitation of vulnerable mount handlers
#
# Security Benefits:
# - Prevents BadUSB attacks that rely on automatic device handling
# - Blocks malicious devices from auto-executing payloads
# - Reduces attack surface from corrupted filesystems
# - Gives users control over device mounting decisions
#
# Protection Mechanisms:
# 1. Prevents automatic loading of device handlers
# 2. Disables automatic mounting for all storage types
# 3. Forces manual mounting through proper user tools
# 4. Includes boot-time safety check
#
# Note: Rules include TEST!="/run/.containerboot" to ensure they don't
# interfere with the live system boot process
