# UDisks2 Global Configuration: Automount Prevention
#
# Purpose:
# This configuration provides an additional security layer by preventing 
# automatic mounting of storage devices at the desktop environment level.
#
# Security Benefits:
# - Complements udev rules by blocking automounting in the desktop environment
# - Prevents race conditions in device handling
# - Forces conscious user decisions for device mounting
# - Reduces risk from malicious storage devices
#
# How it works with udev:
# While udev rules block automatic device handling at the system level,
# this configuration ensures the desktop environment doesn't override
# those settings or provide an alternative automounting path.
#
# Boot Process Safety:
# These settings are applied after the live system is fully operational,
# ensuring they don't interfere with the boot process.

[defaults]
# Globally disable automatic mounting
automount=false
automount-open=false

# Require user interaction for all mount operations
mount-options=noauto,noexec,nosuid

# Additional security controls
presentation-hide-internal=true
