### Live Environment Specific Sysctl Configuration ###

## Container and Namespace Settings
# Enable unprivileged user namespaces - required for many live tools and containers
kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone = 1
# Increase the maximum number of user namespaces for live environment tools
user.max_user_namespaces = 10000

## Memory Management for Live Environment
# Increase cache pressure to prevent tmpfs from consuming too much memory
# Higher values make the kernel more aggressive about reclaiming memory
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 150

# Reduce swappiness for better live environment performance
# Lower value reduces swap usage, keeping more in RAM for better responsiveness
vm.swappiness = 10

# Increase dirty ratio for better tmpfs performance
# Higher values allow more dirty pages before forcing writeback
vm.dirty_ratio = 40
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 10

## I/O Settings for Live Environment
# Optimize read-ahead for overlay filesystem
# Smaller value reduces memory usage and is better for random access
vm.page-cluster = 0

# Increase maximum number of file handles
# Important for overlay filesystem operation
fs.file-max = 2097152

# Default dirty page expiration time - spins may adjust
vm.dirty_expire_centisecs = 1500

# Live environment specific memory limits
kernel.shmmax = 8589934592                    # Reduced shared memory segment size (8GB) for typical live systems
kernel.shmall = 2097152                       # Adjusted total shared memory pages for live environment

# Live environment specific kernel settings
kernel.panic = 180                            # Extended panic timeout for live environment recovery
kernel.panic_on_oops = 180                    # Extended oops timeout for live environment recovery
kernel.sysrq = 1                              # Enable SysRq for emergency control in live environment
