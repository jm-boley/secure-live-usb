# /etc/security/limits.d/resource-limits.conf - System resource limits configuration
#
# This file sets various resource limits for all users on the system. These limits
# help protect the system from accidental or malicious resource exhaustion.
#
# Limit Types:
# - soft: Warning limit that users can temporarily exceed
# - hard: Maximum limit that users cannot exceed
#
# Resources:
# - nproc: Maximum number of processes a user can run
# - nofile: Maximum number of open files per process
#
# Format:
# <domain>  <type>  <item>   <value>   # Description
#
# Notes:
# - '*' in domain means the limit applies to all users
# - Values should be adjusted based on system resources and workload

# Process limits (nproc):
# - Prevents fork bombs and process table exhaustion
# - Recommended: soft < hard to allow temporary spikes
*          soft    nproc     4096      # Default process limit
*          hard    nproc     8192      # Maximum process limit

# File descriptor limits (nofile):
# - Critical for high-traffic servers and development workloads
# - Important for preventing "too many open files" errors
*          soft    nofile    8192      # Default open files limit
*          hard    nofile    16384     # Maximum open files limit
