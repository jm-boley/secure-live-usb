## Security Features

### Intrusion Detection: Your Digital Security Guard
We've built a comprehensive intrusion detection system that never sleeps:
- Real-time system monitoring watches for suspicious activities as they happen
- Network-based detection catches malicious traffic before it causes harm
- File integrity monitoring ensures critical system files haven't been tampered with
- Behavioral analysis spots unusual patterns that might indicate compromise
- Smart alert management helps you focus on what matters

### Audit Capabilities: Leave No Stone Unturned
Security isn't just about prevention - it's about understanding what happened:
- System call auditing gives you visibility into process behavior
- Comprehensive network traffic logging for forensic analysis
- Authentication tracking to spot unauthorized access attempts
- File access monitoring helps trace data breaches
- Security event logging provides the evidence you need

### Network Monitoring: Complete Visibility
Your network is your responsibility, and we give you the tools to own it:
- Deep protocol analysis helps you understand application behavior
- Real-time traffic inspection catches threats as they emerge
- Bandwidth monitoring ensures resources are used appropriately
- Connection tracking helps map communication patterns
- Advanced anomaly detection spots the unusual in your normal traffic

Why this matters: In today's interconnected world, network visibility isn't optional. These tools give you the insight you need to protect your systems and respond to threats effectively. From basic connectivity issues to sophisticated attacks, you'll have the visibility and control you need.
