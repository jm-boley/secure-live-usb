# Network Hardening Implementation Reference

This document provides a detailed account of the network security measures implemented in our custom Debian-based distribution.

## Network Security Implementation

Our network security implementation uses nftables with a defense-in-depth approach, combining multiple security mechanisms:

### Rate Limiting Implementation
  **ICMP Traffic**: Limited to 10 packets per second to prevent ICMP floods while maintaining network diagnostics
  **Standard TCP Services**: 30 connections per minute per source, balancing service availability with DoS protection
  **Critical Services**: 60 connections per minute per source for essential services requiring higher throughput

### Anti-Scan Protection
  **Port Scan Detection**: Tracks and blocks sources making multiple failed connection attempts
  **Service Probing Protection**: Rate limits on new connection attempts per source IP
  **Connection State Tracking**: Maintains state table for legitimate connections
  **Auto-blacklisting**: Temporary blocks for IPs showing scanning behavior

### TCP Protocol Security
  **Flag Validation**: Enforces RFC-compliant TCP flag combinations
  **Invalid Flag Detection**: Blocks packets with illegal flag combinations (e.g., SYN+FIN, FIN without ACK)
  **State Tracking**: Validates TCP handshake sequence
  **Anti-Spoofing**: Verifies packet sequences match expected states

### Connection Tracking
  **State-based Filtering**: Allows only packets belonging to established connections
  **Dynamic State Table**: Adapts to connection volume while preventing state table overflow
  **Timeout Optimization**: Customized timeouts for different protocols and states
  **Invalid State Drop**: Immediate rejection of packets not matching valid state transitions

### Logging Implementation
  **Security Event Logging**: Records suspicious activity with source details
  **Rate-limited Logging**: Prevents log flooding during attacks
  **Attack Pattern Recognition**: Logs patterns indicating potential attacks
  **Audit Trail**: Maintains detailed records for security analysis

## System Hardening Implementation

Our system hardening measures focus on kernel and system-level security while maintaining usability:

### Kernel Security Parameters
  **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)**
  Implemented: `kernel.randomize_va_space = 2`
  Rationale: Maximum protection against buffer overflow exploits
  Impact: Negligible performance impact, significant security benefit

  **Restricted Core Dumps**
  Implementation: Disabled for sensitive processes
  Rationale: Prevents exposure of sensitive data in crash dumps
  Trade-off: More challenging debugging, but essential for security

  **Network Stack Hardening**
  TCP SYN cookie protection
  RFC1337 compliance
  Reverse path filtering
  ICMP redirect restrictions
  Rationale: Prevents common network-based attacks

### File System Security
  **Mount Options**
  noexec on /tmp and temporary storage
  nosuid where appropriate
  nodev restrictions
  Rationale: Prevents execution of malicious code from mounted filesystems

### Process Isolation
  **Resource Limits**
  Controlled through systemd slices
  Memory, CPU, and I/O restrictions
  Rationale: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks

### Security vs. Usability Considerations
  **Rate Limiting**: Balanced to prevent abuse while allowing legitimate use
  **Connection Tracking**: Sized for typical workloads while preventing state table floods
  **Resource Controls**: Tuned to allow normal operation while preventing abuse
  **Logging**: Detailed enough for security analysis without overwhelming storage

This implementation demonstrates our commitment to security while maintaining system usability. Each measure is carefully chosen and configured to provide maximum protection with minimal impact on legitimate usage patterns.
